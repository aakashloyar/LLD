# YAGNI - You Aren't Gonna Need It
-> donot build features, abstractions, flexibility until you actually need them


-> let us take a example you are credit card company
-> you also want to handle international payment
-> that you want to do in future 
-> donot need to do it now 
-> do it in future only 
-> YAGNI says keep it simple until requirement exists
-> refactoring is cheaper than maintaining unused flexibility
