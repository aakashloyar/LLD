# 23 OOPS design patterns

-> each design pattern will be under 1 of the 3 categoy
1. Creational (Birth)
-> how object are created

2. Structural (Body)
-> how classes and objects are structured

3. Behavioural (Brain and communication)
-> how object interact and behave 

🟢 Creational Patterns
1. Singleton
2. Factory Method
3. Abstract Factory
4. Builder
5. Prototype

🔵 Structural Patterns
1. Adapter
2. Bridge
3. Composite
4. Decorator
5. Facade
6. Flyweight
7. Proxy

🟠 Behavioral Patterns
1. Strategy
2. Observer
3. Command
4. State
5. Template Method
6. Chain of Responsibility
7. Mediator
8. Memento
9. Iterator
10. Visitor


-> now here we will be discussing some important of them

1. Strategy

4. Observer
5. Decorator
6. Factory
7. Adapter
8. Facade

//loose vs tight coupling
//tight coupling occurs when classes depend on concreted implementation
//to avoid it use interface and abstract
